I'm currently making the shift from logistics to software development. It's been an exciting journey of learning and growth so far and I am very happy to have found this path.

My journey began in the summer of 2022 when I took the initiative to teach myself the fundamentals of programming. Over several months, I dedicated myself to solving coding challenges, crafting small web apps, and delving deeper into Python and Javascript. As my interest grew, I became fully immersed in the world of software development.

Once I knew this is something I truly enjoyed, I enrolled in a 6-month non-profit bootcamp for military veterans. The curriculum layed a solid foundation for full stack web development, teaching front-end and back-end frameworks along with Docker, PostgreSQL, and AWS. I have since used these skills to develop, containerize, and deploy full-stack applications which are pinned below with links in the README file.

Right now, I'm deep into creating a bouldering competition web app, a project that blends my programming skills with my passion for rock climbing. I am also working my way through leetcode's data structures and algorithms course.
